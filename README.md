# Baggage tracking prototype using Hyperledger Fabric

## INSTALLATION

### STEP 1
First of all you need to get the *fabric-samples* folder. To do this, go to [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples)

### STEP 2
For proper operation, the repository **bagTrack** must be placed inside *fabric-samples* folder

The *baggage* repository **inside** *chaincode* repo must be placed inside `fabric-samples/chaincode`

## HOW DOES IT WORKS?

There are two folders **bagTrack** and **chaincode** 

### bagTrack
**bagTack** contains the scripts to run to start the network and the chaincode package to install. 

### chaincode
**chaincode** contains **baggage chaincode** in JavaScript
